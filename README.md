# nvim-config

My personal nvim configurations

This configurations are most based on the videos of [@typecraft_dev](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev)

## How to install

Make a folder named nvim under ~/.config
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
```

And clone this repository, then open nvim, lazy will automatically download plugins.

Then just close and reopen nvim.
